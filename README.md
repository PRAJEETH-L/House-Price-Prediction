**Home Price Prediction**

**Overview**

The Home Price Prediction project aims to predict house prices using various data science and machine learning techniques. This project leverages historical data on home features to build predictive models that can estimate the value of homes.

**Features**

Data Collection: Aggregates data from various sources including property listings and historical sales records.

Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares data for analysis by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes data to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations.

Feature Engineering: Creates new features based on existing data to improve model performance.

Model Building: Trains multiple machine learning models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.

Model Evaluation: Evaluates model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.

Prediction: Provides functionality to predict home prices based on user inputs.

**Getting Started**

To get started with the Home Price Prediction project, follow these steps:

**Prerequisites**

Python 3.7 or higher.

Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost (Install using pip)
